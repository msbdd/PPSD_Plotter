# Data Acknowledgment


This example uses the seismic data from the [IU Network](https://www.fdsn.org/networks/detail/IU/)

The original data was collected by the **Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory / USGS** and distributed via the **International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN)**:

> Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory/USGS. (1988). *Global Seismograph Network (GSN - IRIS/USGS)* [Dataset]. International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks. [https://doi.org/10.7914/SN/IU](https://doi.org/10.7914/SN/IU)

Seismic waveform and station metadata were accessed using the [EarthScope FDSN Web Services](https://service.iris.edu/), which provide public access to seismic data managed by the IRIS Data Management Center.
